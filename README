Introduction
============
This software is still in development, stay tuned.

This framework is intended to simply making agi applications. You will 
extend PAGIApplication and your signal handler, error handler, init, and
shutdown methods are automatically setup and called.

Please see docs/examples/quickstart for a very basic example. You'll need
something like this in your dialplan:

[default]
exten => 1,1,AGI(/tmp/PAGI/docs/examples/quickstart/run.sh,a,b,c,d)
exten => 1,n,Hangup

Currently there is no manual or comprehensive documentation, so please refer
to the examples, it's really all there (I will write the documentation as
soon as possible). Please contact me if you have any comments, doubts, or
any kind of feedback. Send an email to: marcelog@gmail.com

AutoDial
========
CallFiles are supported. You can also schedule a call in the future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fax
===
Sending and receiving faxes is supported using spandsp (applications SendFax
and ReceiveFax).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Available Facades
=================
PAGI\Client\CDR: Provided to access cdr variables.
PAGI\Client\ChannelVariables: Provided to access channel variables and asterisk
environment variables.
PAGI\Client\CallerID: Provided to access caller id variables.
PAGI\Client\Result: Provided to wrap up the result for agi commands.
PAGI\CallSpool\CallFile: Call file facade.
PAGI\CallSpool\CallSpool: Call spool facade.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Results
=======
For every operation, a Result is provided. Some operations decorate this
Result to add functionality, like PlayResult, ReadResult, etc. For example,
a stream file will return a PlayResult, which decorates a ReadResult which 
in turn, decorated a Result.
* PAGI\Client\DialResult
* PAGI\Client\ExecResult
* PAGI\Client\ReadResult
* PAGI\Client\PlayResult
* PAGI\Client\FaxResult
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging, logging
==================

You need log4php (http://logging.apache.org/log4php/) if you want debugging
output from the container. Just make sure you copy it to the include_path and
PAGI will pick it up from there.

This means that this is NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR A DEPLOY. It's not even a
requirement at develop time (except when you really want debug output).
You can use the included example of a log4php.properties file in
docs/examples/quickstart.

Of course it is recommended that you do not set DEBUG output in your log4php
configuration (or remove it from the include path so PAGI will notice and not
use it). This *will* create a difference in performance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developers
==========
* build.xml is a phing build file, not ant.
* It's very possible that you may need to edit build.properties.
* Available main targets: all, build, test, report.
* Tools run: phpdoc, phploc, phpcs, phpmd, phpcpd, phpdepend, phpunit.
