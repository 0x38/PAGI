Debugging, logging
==================

You need log4php (http://logging.apache.org/log4php/) if you want debugging
output from the container. Just make sure you copy it to the include_path and
Ding will pick it up from there.

This means that this is NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR A DEPLOY. It's not even a
requirement at develop time (except when you really want debug output).
You can use the included example of a log4php.properties file in
docs/examples/quickstart.

Of course it is recommended that you do not set DEBUG output in your log4php
configuration (or remove it from the include path so PAGI will notice and not
use it). This *will* create a difference in performance.
