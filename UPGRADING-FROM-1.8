There is a small b/c break with PAGI < 1.9.0.

PAGIApplication used to get an agi client by itself. Since 1.9.0 you have
to pass it in the option arguments, like:

$clientOptions = array('log4php.properties' => '/etc/log4php.properties');
$client = PAGI\Client\Impl\ClientImpl::getInstance($clientOptions);

$app = new MyPAGIApplication(array('pagiClient' => $client));

In this way, you can use your pagi application with any agi client (i.e: AsyncAgi
from pami).

If you are using the PAGILauncher, it is updated to work this way.

See docs/examples/quickstart for the full example.
